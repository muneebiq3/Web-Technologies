                                In this lab task, we created a basic library website using HTML and inline CSS. 
                                The website consists of multiple sections: a header with navigation links, 
                                an "About Us" section detailing the library's history, a catalog displaying featured books, 
                                a services section outlining the library's offerings, and a contact form. Inline CSS was used 
                                to style the layout and elements directly within the HTML file. The task focuses on structuring 
                                content while using basic styling techniques to enhance the user interface.
